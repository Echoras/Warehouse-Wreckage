# Warehouse-Wreckage
A small physics-based destruction game made in Unreal Engine. You control a cannon and fire balls at stacked crates and structures — your goal is simple: make a mess.

##  About the Project

This project was made as a learning exercise in Unreal Engine.  
I explored:

-  World design and entity placement  
-  Lighting and materials  
-  Blueprint scripting for game logic and restarts  
-  Physics interactions and collisions  
-  Game restart system when cannonballs run out  

It’s a short, simple sandbox, but a fun way to test Unreal’s physics and lighting systems.
